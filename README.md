# Bash File Checker

A simple Bash script created as part of Bash scripting practice.

## What it does
- Prompts the user for a filename
- Checks whether the file exists
- Displays whether the file is:
  - readable
  - writable
  - executable

## Purpose
This script was written to practice:
- reading user input in Bash
- using file test operators (`-e`, `-r`, `-w`, `-x`)
- conditional logic with `if` / `else` / `fi`
